# ML Schema

ML-Schema is a collaborative, community effort with a mission to develop, maintain, and promote standard schemas for data mining and machine learning algorithms, datasets, and experiment

See the wiki for more details: https://github.com/ML-Schema/core/wiki

**Guidelines**
* Open GitHub issues for any kind of discussion. Selected items will be discussed during telco's. For instance, see how this works for schema.org
* Store all schema in http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/. This you can load in Protege, Jena,... if you want to edit them locally.
* Use the GitHub Wiki for information relevant to the group and users: https://github.com/ML-Schema/core/wiki
* Include structure (inheritance, value bounds) so arrive at a non-ambiguous schema.
* We use namespace 'mls' and will register this at PURL asap.
* If there is an issue to discuss, first create a GitHub issue, and then label it as 'discuss in call'
